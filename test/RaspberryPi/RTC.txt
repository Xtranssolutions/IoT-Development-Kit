Step 1:Run sudo nano /boot/config.txt to edit the pi configuration and add your RTC chip:
 
    Add this in the last line of the file
    dtoverlay =i2c-rtc,ds1307
 
Step2: Save it and run sudo reboot to start again. 
Log in and run sudo i2cdetect -y 1 and observe the UU
 
Step 3: Disable the "fake hwclock" which interferes with the 'real' hwclock
sudo apt-get -y remove fake-hwclock
sudo update-rc.d -f fake-hwclock remove
sudo systemctl disable fake-hwclock
Now with the fake-hw clock off, you can start the original 'hardware clock' script.
 
Step 4: Run sudo nano /lib/udev/hwclock-set and comment out these three lines:
#if [ -e /run/systemd/system ] ; then
# exit 0
#fi
Step 5: When you first plug in the RTC module, it's going to have the wrong time because it has to be set once. 
You can always read the time directly from the RTC with 
sudo hwclock -D -r
Step 6: To set the time in Raspberry pi using RTC Module execute following Command
	sudo hwclock â€“w
Step 7:To read time from RTC Module execute following Command
	sudo hwclock -r
